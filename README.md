# FinalTask
Hello, this is a report about my final task in the course " Telecommunication Software"
This project is coded with react.js

In this project there is two main parts :
-A server 
-A public interface

As it was asked, I don't publish the repertory directly ( to not add node_modules) 

The project is mainly a login interface. It permit to public to log to the server and to sign up  on it.

To start the server you need to create a directory with :- the nodes modulesand add the code on it.

After that go on the directory
and launch ther server with -npm start


To start the public interface do the same  that for the server.
